for firebase

for protected API (acessible by only authenticate user) 
we send extra query param with api ?auth=authToken (eg. in LoginAuthentication WelcomeScreen)
by doing so data is only accesible by authenticated user 
if user is not registered then data is not accessible 

change the rule in firebase with this
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth.uid!=null", 
    ".write": "auth.uid!=null",
  }
}
